This is my first solo projecting integrating HTML and CSS with JavaScript.

# Random Button Generator

This is a simple JavaScript project where each button triggers something random — ASCII figures, animal facts, or an occult-style oracle message.

It's mostly just for fun, but I used it to practice working with:
- arrays
- random selection
- DOM manipulation
- preventing repeat outputs
- using Git for version control and deployment

## Features

- Button 1: random ASCII faces and expressions
- Button 2: random animal facts with matching ASCII or emoji
- Button 3: oracle-style responses loosely inspired by Major Arcana
- Clear button: resets the output terminal

## Live Site

## Notes

This was my first time properly using Git with VS Code and GitHub Pages. It’s been cool seeing my commits build up over time and watching the site improve with each version.

Mobile issues were fixed, and layout tweaks were made to make the terminal more readable across screen sizes.
